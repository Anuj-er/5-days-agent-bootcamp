Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is making the most profound and rapid impact. Here are some of the newest and most exciting developments:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Beyond Prediction, Towards Creation:** Instead of just analyzing existing molecules, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) are now being used to *design entirely new molecules* from scratch. These models can be trained to optimize for specific properties like binding affinity to a target protein, solubility, or low toxicity.\n*   **\"De Novo\" Drug Design:** This is often referred to as \"de novo\" drug design. Researchers are giving AI a set of desired characteristics, and it's generating novel chemical structures that meet those criteria. This dramatically expands the chemical space that can be explored.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are reporting success in generating novel small molecules that show promising activity in preclinical studies.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Deep Genomics and Proteomics:** AI is being used to analyze vast datasets of genomic and proteomic information (DNA, RNA, protein sequences, expression levels). This helps identify novel disease-causing genes or proteins that could serve as drug targets.\n*   **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:** AI algorithms can map complex biological networks and pathways, revealing how different molecules interact. This helps researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of disease and identify crucial intervention points.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning it's possible to design a molecule that can effectively bind to and modulate its activity.\n\n**3. Accelerated Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can virtually screen millions of potential drug candidates against a target much faster and cheaper than traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) in a lab.\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are becoming increasingly accurate at predicting a drug's Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties. This helps filter out candidates that are likely to fail later in development due to poor pharmacokinetics or safety concerns.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once promising \"lead\" compounds are identified, AI can help fine-tune their structure to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and enhance bioavailability.\n\n**4. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug databases, scientific literature, and patient data to identify approved drugs that might be effective for treating different diseases. This is a faster and less risky approach than developing entirely new drugs.\n*   **Examples:** AI has been used to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed for conditions like COVID-19 or certain types of cancer.\n\n**5. Integration with Other Technologies:**\n\n*   **Automated Labs:** AI is increasingly being integrated with robotic lab automation. This creates \"closed-loop\" systems where AI designs molecules, robots synthesize and test them, and AI learns from the results to design even better molecules in the next iteration.\n*   **Quantum Computing:** While still nascent, there's a growing interest in combining AI with quantum computing for more complex molecular simulations and drug design challenges that are currently intractable for classical computers.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** A wave of highly specialized biotech companies are emerging, with AI as their core technology (e.g., **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Atomwise**, **Exscientia**, **Insilico Medicine**).\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring these AI-driven startups, recognizing the transformative potential.\n*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** Many AI drug discovery efforts are focusing on challenging areas like neurodegenerative diseases, rare diseases, and antibiotic resistance, where traditional methods have faced significant hurdles.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Quantity:** AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. Ensuring high-quality, diverse, and comprehensive biological and chemical data is crucial.\n*   **Validation in Real-World Settings:** While AI can predict, ultimate validation still requires rigorous clinical trials.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model suggests a particular molecule can be challenging, which is important for scientific understanding and regulatory approval.\n*   **Cost and Accessibility:** Developing and deploying these sophisticated AI platforms can be expensive.\n\nOverall, AI is no longer just a buzzword in drug discovery; it's actively reshaping the landscape, promising to accelerate the delivery of new and better therapies to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned, which is **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**. This is a crucial step in drug discovery because finding the right \"target\" – usually a specific protein or molecule in the body that's involved in a disease – is the first hurdle to designing an effective drug.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n\n**1. Unlocking Insights from Massive Biological Data:**\n\n*   **The Data Deluge:** We now generate enormous amounts of biological data. This includes:\n    *   **Genomic Data:** DNA sequences from millions of individuals, revealing genetic predispositions to diseases.\n    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** Information about which genes are active (and at what levels) in different cells and tissues, and how this changes during disease.\n    *   **Proteomic Data:** The complete set of proteins present in a cell or organism, their structures, and their interactions.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** Electronic health records, patient-reported outcomes, and data from clinical trials.\n*   **AI's Role:** Human researchers can't possibly sift through all this data manually. AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, can:\n    *   **Identify Patterns:** Detect subtle correlations between genetic mutations, gene expression changes, or protein alterations and specific diseases.\n    *   **Find Hidden Associations:** Uncover relationships that might not be obvious through traditional hypothesis-driven research.\n\n**2. Deep Genomics and Proteomics Analysis:**\n\n*   **Genetics of Disease:** AI can analyze large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to pinpoint genetic variations associated with a disease. But it goes further: it can infer the *functional impact* of these variations. For instance, does a mutation affect a protein's stability, its interaction with other molecules, or its production level?\n*   **Protein Interactions:** AI models can predict how proteins interact with each other. This is vital because diseases often arise from disruptions in these complex protein networks. By understanding these interactions, researchers can identify key \"nodes\" or proteins that, if targeted, could restore normal function.\n*   **Single-Cell Analysis:** AI is essential for making sense of single-cell sequencing data, which provides a highly granular view of cellular heterogeneity. This allows researchers to identify specific cell types or states that are driving a disease, and thus, potential targets within those cells.\n\n**3. Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n\n*   **Mapping the Biological Web:** Imagine the body's biological processes as an intricate web. Diseases often cause specific parts of this web to become overactive, underactive, or dysfunctional. AI can help map these complex \"biological networks\" and \"pathways.\"\n*   **Identifying Bottlenecks and Control Points:** By analyzing these networks, AI can identify critical proteins or genes that act as \"control points.\" Targeting these points could have a significant impact on the disease. For example, if a particular pathway is overactive in cancer, AI can help pinpoint the upstream enzyme that's driving this activity.\n*   **Systems Biology Approach:** This moves beyond studying individual molecules to understanding how a system (like a cell or an organism) functions as a whole. AI is the key tool enabling this holistic approach.\n\n**4. Predicting Target Druggability:**\n\n*   **Not All Targets Are Equal:** Even if AI identifies a protein involved in a disease, it doesn't automatically mean it's a good drug target. A drug needs to be able to bind effectively to the target, and that binding should have a beneficial effect.\n*   **AI's Predictive Power:** AI models can be trained on data from known drug targets and non-targets. They can then learn to predict:\n    *   **Binding Pockets:** Whether a protein has a surface feature (a \"pocket\") where a drug molecule could physically attach.\n    *   **Modulatory Potential:** Whether modulating the activity of this target is likely to be therapeutic without causing harmful side effects.\n    *   **\"Druggability Scores\":** AI can assign a score to a potential target, helping researchers prioritize which ones are most promising to pursue.\n\n**Impact of AI in Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI significantly accelerates the process of identifying and validating targets, which traditionally could take years.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover targets that might have been missed by human researchers using conventional methods, leading to entirely new therapeutic strategies.\n*   **Precision:** By analyzing complex biological systems, AI helps identify more precise targets, potentially leading to more effective and less toxic drugs.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming target identification from a process of educated guessing and laborious experimentation into a data-driven, predictive science. It allows researchers to look at biological systems with unprecedented detail and identify the most leverageable points for therapeutic intervention.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about companies heavily involved in **AI-driven target identification and validation** within the drug discovery space.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
